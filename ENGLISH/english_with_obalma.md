## So when you're at home, can you <u>run down to</u> the kitchen in your <u>underpants</u>(quan^ sip. dui`) in the middle of the night if you're hungry?
- It's fine, I can <u>run down to the store</u> right now and get it.
- Let me <u>run down there</u> in my underware and see what's going on, in the dark. Call the police!

## If you do sothing <u>on your own</u> , you do it without help. (be on your own)
- Listen to me. I need to do this <u>on my own</u> If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?
- I'm type ping these words on my own.

## It's <u>been a while</u> since I cooked. (mean long time has passed since I last did something)
- It's <u> been a while</u> since I read a actual newspaper.
- Hi T, it's been a while.
